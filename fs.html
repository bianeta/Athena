                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                  
                            <db> In this book Red is our main chararecter. Red and her friends are in an RV on a trip. But then their RV breaks down. After that they realize there's a sniper right outside their RV. Then we learn tons of background storys. Oliver kills an old couple by "acident". They vote for someone to to kick out the van, and sacarafice to the shooter. The voting is blind,but Red gets voted out.  After shes voted out something weird happens. She gets thrown out the RV but no one shoots at her. Arthur then saves Red. In the end of the book we learn Aurthur is actually the second Sniper (  And the son of a mafia/ gang member). Oliver dies and Aurthur runs away. </db>

       <body> I actually loved this book from what I remember. I would love to read it again. The ending felt better then The Reapreance of Rachel Price. It didn't feel like the ending was being rushed at all. I loved all the charecters EXCEPT Oliver (obviiously). I wish we would have found out were thoose curtains were from, Red focused on them non-stop.  "</body>
