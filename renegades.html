 <db>This book was VERY slow in the beginning, so it definitely took a while for me to get into it. After I did, I could not put it down. I loved the blooming romance between Adrian and Nova. Speaking of Nova, I think she was a good character with motivation, which is important. The ending also had me shocked. I genuinely thought Ace Anarchy was dead. As someone on the second book, I  can say that the pace picked up a little bit. Though it still follows the slow-paced to fast-paced ratio.
