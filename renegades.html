<strong>Reiview</strong><br>
<body>This book was VERY slow in the beginning, so it definitely took a while for me to get into it. After I did, I could not put it down. I loved the blooming romance between Adrian and Nova. Speaking of Nova, I think she was a good character with motivation, which is important. The ending also had me shocked. I genuinely thought Ace Anarchy was dead. As someone on the second book, I  can say that the pace picked up a little bit. Though it still follows the slow-paced to fast-paced ratio

         There are many dangerous people in this world. But there are also many good people. Brave people. No matter how bad things get, we have to remember that. So long as there are heroes in this world, theres hope that tomorrow might be better.
