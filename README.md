This project is for the Athena Award. I made a website where you can see my reviews on books. The Site is called Not So Spoiler Free. I chose this because I really love books, and I want to get better at voicing my own opinion on things. Since im a new coder, I decided to do something easy like this website. I definitely had a hard time figuring out what tags did what,and how to problem solve for coding. I learned how to create a site from scratch and how to code with HTML and CSS. Either way, I hope you enjoy my website and all the hard work I put into it.
