                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                            The Lightning Thief is the first book in the series. Percy finds out hes a demigod. SO he goes to Camp Half-Blood. On the way, his mom also gets disintegrated. Anyway, we learn he's a son of Poseidon. which is a BIG deal because the Big Three arent supposed to have kids. His mom also gets disintegrated on the way to camp. Someone steals Zeus lightning bolt, and EVERYONE thinks Percy did it. He goes on a quest with Annabeth(my favorite) and Grover, and ends up facing off with Luke, who was actually the thief. Oh, and Kronos is kinda behind it all. And he gets his mom back

 <db>Again, I am biased because this book got me back into reading, and for that reason, I love it. Also, this book was super fast-paced, and it held my attention span, which was great. I also 
loved how the characters are around my age, too.
