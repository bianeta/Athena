<db>In this book, our main character in this book is Bel Price. Her mom went missing when she was younger. While her family is filming a documentary on her disappearance. Rachel comes back. IN the end, we find out Bels cousin is actually her sister(*gasp*). We also find out Pat (Bels' grandfather) and her dad had kidnapped Bel's mom. In the end, Bel's dad and Uncle end up getting pushed off a cliff and die(Shocking, I know).

     <db class="medium-text">                  <strong>Review</strong></br>                
 <db>Im going to be honest with you guys. This book definitely was not my favorite Holly Jackson book. The plot was definitely strong; it worked really well with this book. This book kept me entertained, but the ending felt super rushed. In thriller/mystery books, the ending is the best part. So, because it felt rushed, that ruined it for me a bit. To add to that thought, I felt like she just wanted to add murder and the end of the book. Even though it was not necessary. Also, Carter actually being Rachels daughter was so random to me. AND I saw someone make this point, and I HEAVILY agree. Rachel having zero ptsd or trauma whatsoever is crazy( at least from what I remember). Also, I know in Holly Jacksons books the police really do nothing, but she should have just gone to the police and told EVERYTHING. Also, Sherry going to Canada to meet NO ONE sounds pretty sad.
