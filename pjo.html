                            The Lightning Thief is the first book in the series. Percy finds out hes a demigod. SO he goes to Camp Half-Blood. On the way, his mom also gets disintegrated. Anyway, we learn he's a son of Poseidon. which is a BIG deal because the Big Three arent supposed to have kids. His mom also gets disintegrated on the way to camp. Someone steals Zeus lightning bolt, and EVERYONE thinks Percy did it. He goes on a quest with Annabeth(my favorite) and Grover, and ends up facing off with Luke, who was actually the thief. Oh, and Kronos is kinda behind it all. And he gets his mom back

 <db>Again, I am biased because this book got me back into reading, and for that reason, I love it. Also, this book was super fast-paced, and it held my attention span, which was great. I also 
loved how the characters are around my age, too.

                       <db>The Sea of Monsters is the second book, and after Luke left camp, he poisoned Thalia's tree.  And so as a result, the magical borders are dying. Percy finds out he has a cyclops half-brother, Tyson. They go to the Sea of Monsters to get the Golden Fleece. Luke is back, still evil, and Kronos is literally in a coffin. They get back to camp with the fleece in time at the end, and accidentally bring Thalia back from the dead

<db> I will say this book is relatively calm and the least angsty of the series. I LOVE the siren scene between Annabeth and Percy. ( Or should I say Percabeth). Other than that, I loved the blooming friendship between Clarise and Percy. Tyson was also an amazing character. I  also adored the fatal flaw aspects because it was something we could all relate to.

<strong>Reiview</strong><br>
<body>
This book was again super good. I love how Percy was slowly starting to get sick of this and just wanted Annabeth back.  I also loved how Percy and Thalia's dynamic started to grow. My favorite scene was the Hoover Dam scene. I also loved Bessie, the sea cow.</body>

   <li class="highlighted-item">"So," Annabeth said. "What did you want to tell me earlier?"
The music was playing. People were dancing in the streets. I said, "I, uh, was thinking we got interrupted at Westover Hall. And.. I think I owe you a dance."
She smiled slowly. "All right, Seaweed Brain."
So I took her hand, and I don't know what everybody else heard, but to me it sounded like a slow dance: a little sad, but maybe a little hopeful, too.

"Let us find the dam snack bar," Zoe said. "We should eat while we can."
Grover cracked a smile. "The dam snack bar?""
Zoe blinked. "Yes. What is funny?""
"Nothing," Grover said, trying to keep a straight face. "I could use some dam french fries."
Even Thalia smiled at that. "And I need to use the dam restroom."

                           The Battle of the Labyrinth is the 4th one. The Labyrinth under the camp connects to EVERYTHING, and Luke plans to use it to attack. Percy and Annabeth lead a quest to find Daedalus, who's actually been alive this whole time. Grover finds Pan (but he's dying), and Nico's dealing with his sister's death.  ( Percy gets exploded and meets Clypso, but makes it back to camp half blood in time for his funeral. Which he crashes.)  Then there is a battle at camp, Daedalus dies, and Kronos takes over Lukes body.

 <db>This book was great. I love how Rachel Elizabeth Dare is back. I also love how we got Percy and Annabeth's first kiss. Speaking of Annabeth, I found her being jealous the whole book super funny.  She did not like Rachel for the entire book. Either way, meeting Calyspo was also cool. In the end, this was still a great book.

<db> OMG, this was such an incredible ending. The battle of Olympus was so sad that I definitely cried. It felt like we were losing character after character. It was wild, but either way, I have a love for this series in my heart. (Writing this review reminds me I need to read Heroes of Olympus) This series also gave me a love for Greek mythology and stories.  This book definitely had tons of angst, but either way, it was incredible.
