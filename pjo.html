                            <body>The Lightning Thief is the first book in the series. Percy finds out hes a demigod. So he goes to Camp Half-Blood. On the way, his mom also gets disintegrated. Anyway, we learn he's a son of Poseidon. which is a BIG deal because the Big Three arent supposed to have kids. His mom also gets disintegrated on the way to camp. Someone steals Zeuss lightning bolt, and EVERYONE thinks Percy did it. He goes on a quest with Annabeth(my favorite) and Grover, and ends up facing off with Luke, who was actually the thief. Oh, and Kronos is kinda behind it all. And he gets his mom back

<strong> Review</strong><br>

<body>Again, I am biased because this book got me back into reading, and for that reason, I love it. Also, this book was super fast-paced, and it held my attention span, which was great. I also 
loved how the characters are around my age, too.

<body>The Sea of Monsters is the second book, and after Luke left camp, he poisoned Thalia's tree.  And so as a result, the magical borders are dying. Percy finds out he has a cyclops half-brother, Tyson. They go to the Sea of Monsters to get the Golden Fleece. Luke is back, still evil, and Kronos is literally in a coffin. They get back to camp with the fleece in time at the end, and accidentally bring Thalia back from the dead

<strong> Review</strong><br>
<body> will say this book is relatively calm and the least angsty of the series. I LOVE the siren scene between Annabeth and Percy. ( Or should I say Percabeth). Other than that, I loved the blooming friendship between Clarise and Percy. Tyson was also an amazing character. I  also adored the fatal flaw aspects because it was something we can all relate too.

Percy: the brown stuff they spread on veggie sandwiches?
Annabeth:No, Seaweed Brain. That's HUMMUS. hubris is worse.
Percy: what could be worse than hummus?
Annabeth: Hubris means deadly pride, Percy. Thinking you can do things better than anyone else... Even the gods.
