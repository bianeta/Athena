                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                  
                            <db> In this book out Main charecter is Paedyn Gray, and Kai Azer. In this world you can either have powers,or have zero and be an Ordinary. Our main female main charecter Paedyn is an ordianry.( I know so shocking gasp). Anyways so Paedyn ends up saving Kai( Whos a prince.) and then she gets selected to go to the purging trials. Which is for elites (aka,people with powers). Kai and Paedyn go through the trials ( Falling in love on the way of course). In the end at the last trial( there was I belive three in total) Paedyn makes it to the end and her friend ends up getting killed.  Peadyn was also apart of this resistance,so after her firend dies she kills the king.   Kai sees her kill his dad and tells her to run away.  </db>

       <body> This book was okay. I liked the chararecters, but there wasn't anything super special about it. I was able to compare it to the Hunger Games a lot, Some people even say its like The Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard. I havent read that book yet,so il have to take peoples word for it. I wil say in the end the book starts to differentiate its-self near the end. Im currently on the second book,and will say it isn't like the first one in the series. In the end over all, the book was actually good.</db>
