                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                            The Naturals by Jennifer Lynn Barnes has grown to become one of my favorite murder mystery series of all time. In this book, we follow 17-year-old Cassie Hobbes, whose mom dies (that's super important), who is actually a natural profiler. Long story short, she gets recruited for an FBI program for teens like her. Those who have a natural talent for things that the FBI trains people to do. Cassie meets kids like her and a mentor, Lacy Locke, who's an FBI profiler. Cassie ends up getting a stalker, and murders start happening that have to do with her mom. And in the end, the killer sets a trap, and Dean, Cassie, and Michael all fall for it. Then we find out that Lacy was actually the killer/UNSUB, and she is also Cassie's aunt. Lacy wanted revenge because her sister (Cassie's mom) had left her in their dad's abusive household because she was pregnant with Cassie. (Dean and Michael were also with her during this confession.) Michael shoots Lacy, and that's my basic summary of The Naturals. (I tried very hard to hit all the major plot points.)

I could not put this book down. I was hooked until the very end. I finished the whole book in a day because it was so good. The story had me craving to know more about these characters' backstories and who this UNSUB/killer was. I definitely thought it was Michael, so to say I was surprised to see the killer be my favorite character is definitely an understatement. I loved the characters and the way they were written.  I love how all the characters have unique backstories, not just the main or the love interest.  Especially with Lacy, her plot line and her wanting Cassie to be like her to an extent was so crazy. I could go on forever about this series, but for me to finish this project in time, I sadly can not </db>

        <li>If this book were a song, it would 100% be Family Line by Conan Gray
</li >
        <li>If this book were a food, it would be a soup, maybe like clam chowder I can't explain this, but it makes so much sense, just think about it </li db>
        <li>While reading this book, my emotions were a mix between, confused, happiness, and also shock.
