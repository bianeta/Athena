                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                            The Naturals by Jennifer Lynn Barnes has grown to become one of my favorite murder mystery series of all time. In this book, we follow 17-year-old Cassie Hobbes, whose mom dies (that's super important), who is actually a natural profiler. Long story short, she gets recruited for an FBI program for teens like her. Those who have a natural talent for things that the FBI trains people to do. Cassie meets kids like her and a mentor, Lacy Locke, who's an FBI profiler. Cassie ends up getting a stalker, and murders start happening that have to do with her mom. And in the end, the killer sets a trap, and Dean, Cassie, and Michael all fall for it. Then we find out that Lacy was actually the killer/UNSUB, and she is also Cassie's aunt. Lacy wanted revenge because her sister (Cassie's mom) had left her in their dad's abusive household because she was pregnant with Cassie. (Dean and Michael were also with her during this confession.) Michael shoots Lacy, and that's my basic summary of The Naturals. (I tried very hard to hit all the major plot points.)

I could not put this book down. I was hooked until the very end. I finished the whole book in a day because it was so good. The story had me craving to know more about these characters' backstories and who this UNSUB/killer was. I definitely thought it was Michael, so to say I was surprised to see the killer be my favorite character is definitely an understatement. I loved the characters and the way they were written.  I love how all the characters have unique backstories, not just the main or the love interest.  Especially with Lacy, her plot line and her wanting Cassie to be like her to an extent was so crazy. I could go on forever about this series, but for me to finish this project in time, I sadly can not </db>

                   <db>Killer Instinct is the second book of the series, and it's my favorite out of the 5, including the novella. In this book, we have yet again another copycat, but this time it's different. The copycat in this book is copying Daniel Redding, aka Dean's dad.  The killer uses the same Mo or Mode of Operation. We also get a new character, Agent Sterling, who is one of my favorites. Back to the UNSUb. Turns out they were a sort of apprentice to Daniel. The UNSUB/unknown subject/killer was Clark and Christiphor. At the end of the book, Cassie and Agent Sterling are kidnapped by Webber, the guy who worked at the Prison. But later got saved by and didn't die.</li>

 <db>I LOVE this book, honestly. I know some people did not like this one, but for me, this one was so good. While writing these reviews, I want to drop everything and reread these books. My favorite character in this series is Agent Sterling for some reason, so us getting bits of her past was super entertaining to me

From the murder, we find out the murders are connected to the Fibonacci sequence. The murder is unclear in this book. We do learn about a cult called The Masters, who are related to the Fibonacci sequence.

<db>This book was my second favorite. I loved the plot (obviously). I also enjoyed the character development and developing friendships. The ending of this book was so crazy. Especially with the whole cult thing. I also still don't understand the Fibonacci spiral, but it's okay. Either way, this book was super good. I enjoyed getting to see more of Sloane's character and my favorite part of her backstory. ( Yes, even if it was sad).

<body>  This book was a combination of happy and sad.  For example, we found Nightshade( he dies). Cassie, you are FINALLY back in your hometown. (she gets kidnapped AGAIN) OH, you found your mom YAYYY. Now you have to stab her ( the FBI arrived two minutes late).

<strong>Reiview</strong><br>
<body>
    This book was so good, no matter how much I cried. This was one of the best endings I could have imagined for this book, even though it was bittersweet to say goodbye to the characters. (Yes, I'm aware of the novella. In case you were wondering it gets a 3-4 /5). Either way, the ending with Cassie's mom definitely made me bawl like a baby. I loved how we got a new character, aka Celine; she was extremely helpful. I also loved Lia's backstory and Michael's.I will admit there were plot holes, like, who is hiring these people in this book for the FBI? Second, why did we decide to continue the program when some people literally got kidnapped TWICE (*cough* Cassie *cough*)
 In the end, this will forever be one of my favorite series, especially in the mystery genre.
