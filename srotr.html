                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                           Sunrise on the reaping is a prequal to the original Hunger Games series. This book follows Haymitch Abernathy in the 50th Quorter Quell, which means theres 48 tributes instead of 24.( 4 get reaped instead of 2). Haymithch basically gets iligally reaped because he stoop up for his girfriend. Then in the tribute parade Luella ( the girl tribute) dies. President Snow then brings in a clone for the games who the district 12 tributes call lulu. Skiping forward Haymitch tries to break the arena, by flooding it and it doesnt work. Then when he goes back to his "base/camp" we find that Aphert( Betees son) is dead. Fast fowerding to the end and Haymitch tries blowing up the arena,after he won the game. Haymitch doesn't die and gets healed by the capital.The capitol treat him badly.  And then his family dies.

 <db> This book is now one of my favorites in the series. I really love Haymitches charecter, he had a lot of attitude and audacity. Which worked well not only for his "rascal" charecter for the capatol ,but also genuinley for making him a good charecter. This book along with almost every Hunger Games book was sad. EXTEREAMLY SAD I cried a good amount while reading, or wanted to cry. I will say I dont remember much of what I didnt like about this book which is crazy. I will add I do wish we got more Lenore Dove in someway,I didnt really cry at her death,because I wasnt super attached to her. In the end I still love the Hunger games so much and didn't mind this book.

   <li class="highlighted-item"> "Good-bye, Maysilee Donner, who I loathed, then grudgingly respected, then loved. Not as a sweetheart or even a friend. A sister, I’d said. But what is that exactly? I think about our journey — everything from sniping with her in those early days after the reaping to battling those pink birds. I guess that's my answer. A sister is someone you fight with and fight for. Tooth and nail."

      <li class="highlighted-item">"When Lenore Dove comes to me now, she's not angry or dying, so I think she's forgiven me. She's grown older with me, her face etched with fine lines, her hair touched with gray. Like she's been living her life beside me as the years passed, instead of lying in her grave. Still so rare and radiant. I fulfilled my promise about the reaping, or at least lent a hand, but she says I can't come to her yet. I have to look after my family."
