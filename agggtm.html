I genuinely enjoyed this book. I will say it could be slow at times, though. Maybe I need to reread it, but this book to me a while to get through. Either way, it was amazing. I also cried super hard at Barney's death.  </db>

                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                       <db>In this book, Pip says shes done with crime until her friend Conner's brother Jamie goes missing. (DUN DUN DUNNN). So, because Pip can't help herself, she gets involved in the case(even though last time she did that, her dog died). Turns out Jamie was talking to a girl called Layla Mead. I  thought Layle mead ended up being Jamie( jokes on me, it was actually Charlie and his wife, Flora. Stanley Forbes goes to see Layla ( who Pip is pretending to be ).   We find Jamie (I'm pretty sure he then leaves). We then find out that Stanley Forbes is actually Child Brunwick; his dad was a serial killer, and he basically made Stanley help.  Sound familiar?( Im looking at you, Dean Redding.  ). In the end, Pip's neighbor, Charlie Green, ends up killing Stanley. Leaving Pip with tons of trauma.

<db>This book was super good. It is crazy how we got this sort of ending from a case that started as a missing persons case. I really wasn't expecting Stanley Forbes to get dragged into all of this. I definitely cried again in the end. Luckily, no dogs died. On a happier note, Pip and Ravi got together. ( Thank you, Holly). They are a super cute couple, and once again, because of Ravi, Pip is safe. Without that dang tracker on Pip's phone, she would be dead( Veronica Sterling should take notes and ACTIVATE tracking devices.) I also love how Ravi again makes sure Pip does not push her limit.

                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>

<body db>The final book is the darkest ( in my opinion). Basically, Pip gets a stalker, and we learn that the stalker is the dt killer/duct tape killer. Which we later learn is Jason Bell. Pip gets kidnapped by Jason Bell. Then, in an act of not wanting to die, Pip then kills Jason Bell. ( To say I was shocked was an understatement) Then, proceed to blame it on Max Hastings

<strong>Reiview</strong><br>
<body>This book was a lot… I will say it was fast-paced, so I definitely enjoyed it a lot because of that. Plot-wise wise it was still insane, umm. I feel like we should change the title of the first book and switch it to the last one. I genuinely wonder if Holly Jackson is on an FBI watch list(Im just kidding,  do not worry). I did cry again at this book when Pip and Ravi broke up, after everything that happened between them. But in the end, it actually was a good book
