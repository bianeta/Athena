I genuinely enjoyed this book. I will say it could be slow at times, though. Maybe I need to reread it, but this book to me a while to get through. Either way, it was amazing. I also cried super hard at Barney's death.  </db>

                       <db>Killer Instinct is the second book of the series, and it's my favorite out of the 5, including the novella. In this book, we have yet again another copycat, but this time it's different. The copycat in this book is copying Daniel Redding, aka Dean's dad.  The killer uses the same Mo or Mode of Operation. We also get a new character, Agent Sterling, who is one of my favorites. Back to the UNSUb. Turns out they were a sort of apprentice to Daniel. The UNSUB/unknown subject/killer was Clark and Christiphor. At the end of the book, Cassie and Agent Sterling are kidnapped by Webber, the guy who worked at the Prison. But later got saved by and didn't die.</db>

<db>I LOVE this book, honestly. I know some people did not like this one, but for me, this one was so good. To be honest, while writing these reviews, I wanted to drop everything and reread these books. My favorite character in this series is Agent Sterling , so us getting bits of her past was super entertaining to me. So maybe in the end im just bias because my favorite charecter shows up in this book.</db>

                            <strong>Summary</strong><br>

<body>In this book, we meet Sloane's family because there has been a killing in a casino. We also meet her brother, but he dies. From the murder, we find out the murders are connected to the Fibonacci sequence. The murder is unclear in this book. We do learn about a cult called The Masters, who are related to the Fibonacci sequence.

<strong>Reiview</strong><br>
<body>This book was my second favorite. I loved the plot (obviously). I also enjoyed the character development and developing friendships. The ending of this book was so crazy. Especially with the whole cult thing. I also still don't understand the Fibonacci spiral, but it's okay. Either way, this book was super good. I enjoyed getting to see more of Sloane's character and my favorite part of her backstory. ( Yes, even if it was sad).
